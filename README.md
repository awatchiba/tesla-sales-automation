# Tesla Sales Automation 🚗📊

This is a small beginner project where I practiced reading a CSV file, cleaning the data, and creating a couple of simple charts using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

The dataset I used is simulated (not real Tesla data). I created it just for learning purposes, but it’s structured to look like a real dataset so I can practice basic data analysis skills.

## 🔍 Project Overview

In this project, I looked at:

- Total sales by region  
- Monthly sales trends  
- How sales change over time  
- Converting dates  
- Grouping data  
- Saving charts  

After running the Python script, it creates two charts:

1. **sales_by_region.png** – shows which region sold the most  
2. **monthly_trend.png** – shows month-to-month sales  

This is mainly a beginner practice project to get more comfortable with Python and datasets.
